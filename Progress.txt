So far, the group has uploaded the CalendarDay, CalendarView, todoItem, todoList, and todoListView classes.
We still require a file reading class so we can locally store event information.


As of right now, we are trying to collaborate by figuring out the names of our classes and methods.
This will allow all of our implementations to become easier.


We are approximately 40% through the entire project.


CalendarView - Shows the calendar (Thor)
	This class displays the calendar UI

todoListView - Sorted list of items (Nebyu)
	This class has a todoItem array that is sorted by the date

todoList - Handles all of the todoItem array functions (Nebyu)
	This class sorts and keeps track of all the events
	Contains a method that returns all events for a specific day

todoItem - Stores the details of a specific event (Time & Date, Title, Description, Whether or not it's completed) (Nebyu)
	This class has Calendar Object, String name, String description, and boolean completed

FileReader - Stores the data for each event (Cameron)
	This class both reads and writes the details of an event
