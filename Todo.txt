Todo list for the todo list project

    General:
        - change todoList and todoItem classes to be TodoList and TodoItem 





    todoList class:
        - method for adding and removing todoItem objects
            - add method should add the object in a sorted position (sorted by Calendar field)
        - public access to ArrayList storing todoItem objects

        possible solutions:
            - have todoList extend `ArrayList<todoItem>` and override the add method






    FileReader/todoList:
        - FileReader's methods currently accepts and returns an ArrayList of todoItem objects, but todoList does not accept or return any ArrayList

        possible solutions:
            - change FileReader to use todoList instances as input and output
            - add a constructor to todoList that accepts an ArrayList of todoItem objects






    General UI:
        - we still a UI element to add todoItem objects to the todoList
        - menu element to save and open files that store the todoList data






    CalendarView:
        - highlight days with todoItem instances
            - possibly also display titles of the first few items

        CalendarDay
            - have window display the todoItem entries for that day
                - sorted by calendar field
                - possibly use a TodoListView







    TodoListView:
        - will eventually display information about todoItem objects in a similar fashion to the way assignments are displayed on Blackboard
