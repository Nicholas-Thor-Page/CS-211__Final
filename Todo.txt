Todo list for the todo list project

    General:
        - change todoList and todoItem classes to be TodoList and TodoItem


    todoItem class:
        - should not extend FileReader, todoItems are not FileReader objects




    todoList class:
        - method for adding and removing todoItem objects
            - add method should add the object in a sorted position (sorted by Calendar field)
        - public access to ArrayList storing todoItem objects

        possible solutions:
            - have todoList extend `ArrayList<todoItem>` and override the add method
                - I (thor) tried this and ran into some issues, may have to be a joint effort




    FileReader:
        - fix compile-time errors
            - use `Calendar.getInstance()` instead of `new Calendar()`
            - raw datatypes (int, char, boolean, long, double, etc.) don't have toString methods
            - calendar does not have getDate() method
            - DateFormat is an abstract class, possibly use SimpleDateFormat
                - Calendar.toString() doesn't print in a format parsable by SimpleDateFormat


        possible solutions:
            - use `boolean + ""` for string conversion
            - calendar.getTime() returns a Date object, may be what you were thinking calendar.getDate() does





    FileReader/todoList:
        - FileReader's methods currently accepts and returns an ArrayList of todoItem objects, but todoList does not accept or return any ArrayList

        possible solutions:
            - change FileReader to use todoList instances as input and output
            - add a constructor to todoList that accepts an ArrayList of todoItem objects






    General UI:
        - we still a UI element to add todoItem objects to the todoList
        - menu element to save and open files that store the todoList data






    CalendarView:
        - highlight days with todoItem instances
            - possibly also display titles of the first few items

        CalendarDay
            - have window display the todoItem entries for that day
                - sorted by calendar field
                - possibly use a TodoListView







    TodoListView:
        - will eventually display information about todoItem objects in a similar fashion to the way assignments are displayed on Blackboard
